# n8n-provision

> n8n instance provisioning plugin. Discover workflows from the official template library (9,166+ templates), GitHub repos, and community platforms, then analyze, import, and batch-deploy them to provision an n8n instance.

## Skills (exposed as subagents)

- `@skill-batch-provisioning` — Provision an n8n instance with multiple workflows in a single batch operation. Handles dependency ordering, credential grouping, progress tracking, rollback strategy, and post-flight verification.
Use when: "provision n8n instance", "batch import workflows", "set up n8n with workflows", "deploy multiple templates", "bootstrap n8n", "install workflow suite", "bulk deploy workflows"

- `@skill-community-source-discovery` — Find n8n workflows from GitHub repositories and third-party platforms when the official template library is insufficient. Use when asked to "find n8n workflow on github", "community n8n workflows", "search github for n8n", "n8n workflow sources", "n8n automation repository", or when official template search returns no good matches.
- `@skill-credential-planning` — Plan and prepare credentials before importing workflows to an n8n instance. Extracts credential requirements from workflow JSON, checks existing credentials, groups by service, and produces a setup checklist.
Use when: "plan credentials for import", "what credentials needed", "n8n credential setup", "prepare credentials before import", "credential requirements", "which credentials do I need", "credential checklist"

- `@skill-examples` — End-to-end scenario walkthroughs for n8n workflow provisioning. This skill should be used when the user asks for "n8n provisioning example", "how to import workflows", "n8n provision walkthrough", "batch import tutorial", "template deploy guide", "n8n setup example", "find and import n8n workflow", "deploy automation suite", or needs a complete example of discovering, analyzing, and deploying n8n workflows.

- `@skill-instance-readiness` — Assess n8n instance readiness before provisioning. Runs health checks, inventories workflows and credentials, detects conflicts, verifies community nodes, and produces a readiness report with pass/warn/fail ratings.
Use when: "check n8n instance", "is n8n ready for provisioning", "n8n health check", "verify n8n instance", "pre-provisioning check", "audit n8n before import", "instance readiness report"

- `@skill-single-workflow-import` — Import and deploy a single workflow to an n8n instance from the official template library or community JSON source. Handles validation, auto-fix, credential stripping, and post-import verification.
Use when: "import n8n workflow", "deploy n8n template", "install n8n automation", "add workflow to n8n", "import template to n8n", "deploy workflow from JSON", "install community workflow"

- `@skill-template-discovery` — Search the official n8n template library (9,166+ templates). Use when asked to "search n8n templates", "find n8n workflow", "browse n8n template library", "n8n workflow catalog", "discover n8n automation", or need to find a template by keyword, node type, task, category, or architectural pattern.
- `@skill-troubleshoot` — Diagnose and fix n8n provisioning and import issues. This skill should be used when the user encounters "n8n import error", "template deploy failed", "workflow validation error", "provisioning troubleshoot", "n8n provision problem", "community node missing", "credential not found", "workflow won't activate", "batch deploy failed", or needs help debugging n8n workflow import and deployment issues.

- `@skill-workflow-analysis` — Analyze an n8n workflow JSON before importing — node inventory, connection topology, credential requirements, security flags, complexity scoring, and compatibility checks. Use when asked to "analyze n8n workflow", "check workflow before import", "workflow compatibility check", "review n8n template", "assess workflow complexity", or before importing any template or community workflow.

## Agents

- `@n8n-provisioner` — n8n instance provisioner and workflow sourcing specialist. Discovers existing workflows from the official template library (9,166+ templates), GitHub repositories, and community platforms, then analyzes, imports, and batch-deploys them to provision an n8n instance.

<example>
Context: User wants to set up a new n8n instance with common automation workflows
user: "I just set up a new n8n instance. Help me provision it with essential workflows for a SaaS startup."
assistant: "I'll use the n8n-provisioner agent to search for relevant templates, analyze compatibility, and batch-deploy them to your instance."
<commentary>
User needs full instance provisioning — agent searches templates by category, analyzes each, plans credentials, and batch-imports.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User is looking for a specific workflow from the community
user: "I need an n8n workflow that syncs Notion databases with Google Sheets. Check the template library and GitHub repos."
assistant: "I'll use the n8n-provisioner agent to search across the template library and community sources for Notion-to-Sheets sync workflows."
<commentary>
User needs multi-source discovery — agent searches official templates first, then falls back to GitHub repos and community sites.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants to import a specific template they found
user: "Deploy template #2947 to my n8n instance and tell me what credentials I need to set up"
assistant: "I'll use the n8n-provisioner agent to analyze the template, deploy it, and provide credential setup guidance."
<commentary>
User has a specific template ID — agent gets template details, analyzes credentials needed, deploys with auto-fix, and guides credential setup.
</commentary>
</example>
