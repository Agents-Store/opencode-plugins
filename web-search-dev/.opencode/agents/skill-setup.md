# Web Search Services Setup Verification

Verify which search and scraping services are connected and operational.

## Service Availability Check

Run one lightweight call per service to confirm connectivity. Not all services need to be active — the plugin works with any subset.

### 1. Firecrawl

```
Tool: firecrawl_search
Input: { "query": "test", "limit": 1 }
```

**Expected:** Returns search results. If error, check `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`.

### 2. Exa

```
Tool: web_search_exa
Input: { "query": "test", "numResults": 1 }
```

**Expected:** Returns results with URLs. If error, check Exa API key.

### 3. Perplexity

```
Tool: perplexity_search
Input: { "query": "test" }
```

**Expected:** Returns AI-synthesized answer. If error, check `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`.

### 4. Jina

```
Tool: read_url
Input: { "url": "https://example.com" }
```

**Expected:** Returns markdown content. Works without API key (rate-limited), with key for full access.

### 5. Context7

```
Tool: contex7-resolve-library-id
Input: { "libraryName": "react" }
```

**Expected:** Returns library ID like `/facebook/react`. No API key required.

### 6. Media Services (Pexels / Unsplash)

Check if media search tools are available in your session:

```
Tool: searchPhotos (Pexels)
Input: { "query": "nature", "per_page": 1 }
```

```
Tool: get_search_photos (Unsplash)
Input: { "query": "nature", "per_page": 1 }
```

Media services require separate MCP configuration — they are not bundled with this plugin.

## Service Status Summary

After running checks, report which services are available:

| Service | Status | Capabilities |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Firecrawl | Connected / Not available | scrape, crawl, search, extract, agent, browser |
| Exa | Connected / Not available | semantic search, code context, page crawl |
| Perplexity | Connected / Not available | AI search, research, reasoning |
| Jina | Connected / Not available | read pages, search, images, classify, deduplicate |
| Context7 | Connected / Not available | framework documentation search |
| Pexels | Connected / Not available | stock photos and videos |
| Unsplash | Connected / Not available | stock photos |

## Working with Partial Availability

Not all services need to be active — the plugin works with any subset. Here's what you can do with common combinations:

| Available Services | You Can Do |
|-------------------|------------|
| Firecrawl only | Scrape, crawl, search, extract structured data, browser automation |
| Jina only | Read pages, search web, image search, classify, deduplicate, batch ops |
| Exa only | Semantic search, code examples, domain-scoped search |
| Perplexity only | AI Q&A, research, reasoning with citations |
| Context7 only | Framework/library documentation search |
| Firecrawl + Jina | Full scraping pipeline with fallbacks |
| Any service + Context7 | Dev workflow with doc search |

If a recommended tool is unavailable, the mcp-patterns skill routing table shows fallback alternatives for every task.

## Common Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `npx` command not found | Node.js not installed | Install Node.js 18+ |
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid API key | Check key in plugin settings or regenerate |
| Connection timeout | Network or firewall | Check internet connectivity |
| MCP server not starting | npm package issue | Run `npx -y firecrawl-mcp` manually to see errors |
| Tool not found | MCP server not configured | Check `.mcp.json` or Claude Code MCP settings |

## What This Skill Does NOT Cover

- Creating API accounts — visit each service's website to sign up
- Configuring MCP servers from scratch — the plugin's `.mcp.json` handles this automatically
