## Skills (exposed as subagents)

- `@skill-bank-api-integration` — This skill should be used when connecting to bank MCP servers, fetching account balances or transaction statements, handling MCP connection errors, or understanding bank API data formats. Relevant for queries like "show my balance", "connect my bank", "fetch last month transactions", or "why is my bank connection failing". Use this skill whenever the user mentions bank accounts, balances, transactions, MCP connections, or any bank data operation, even if they don't explicitly mention "API" or "MCP".
- `@skill-bank-balances` — This skill should be used when showing account balances across all connected banks as a unified table. It covers the BROADCAST pattern for fetching balances from every bank simultaneously and merging them into one view. Use this skill whenever the user asks about their balance, account totals, how much money they have, or wants to see all accounts — even if they only mention one bank, because the plugin always queries all connected banks.
- `@skill-bank-reports` — This skill should be used when generating analytical financial reports — spending by category, income vs expenses, period comparisons, or spending trends across all connected banks. Use this skill whenever the user asks for a financial summary, analytics, spending breakdown, income report, period comparison, or any aggregated view of their financial data, even if they just say "where does my money go" or "скільки я витратив цього місяця".
- `@skill-bank-statements` — This skill should be used when creating a bank statement (виписка) for a specific account and period — a formal document listing all transactions with opening and closing balances. Use this skill whenever the user asks for a statement, виписка, account extract, or needs a formal record of transactions for a specific account, even if they just say "зроби виписку" or "I need a statement for my account".
- `@skill-bank-transactions` — This skill should be used when listing transaction history across all connected banks for a given period as a single chronological list. It covers fetching transactions via BROADCAST, merging results, date range handling, and pagination across different bank APIs. Use this skill whenever the user asks about transactions, recent purchases, spending history, what they spent money on, or wants to see operations across banks — even for a single bank, because the plugin always queries all.
- `@skill-broadcast-pattern` — This skill should be used when setting up real-time financial event notifications, configuring event subscribers, understanding event payload formats, or implementing the broadcast pub/sub system. Relevant for queries like "notify me when balance changes", "set up transaction alerts", "how does the event system work", or "configure WebSocket updates". Use this skill whenever the user asks about real-time updates, event notifications, webhooks, or any form of live data streaming from bank accounts.
- `@skill-budget-alerts` — This skill should be used when setting spending budgets, checking budget utilization, configuring alert thresholds at 50/75/90/100%, or troubleshooting budget alerts. Relevant for queries like "set a monthly dining budget", "how much budget do I have left", "why did I not get a budget alert", or "show budget status for all categories". Use this skill whenever the user mentions spending limits, budgets, overspending, or wants to track expenses against targets, even for simple budget questions.
- `@skill-currency-rates` — This skill should be used when checking currency exchange rates, viewing USD or EUR rate history, comparing rates across banks, or monitoring rate fluctuations. Relevant for queries like "what is the dollar rate today", "show EUR exchange rate history", "compare bank rates for USD", or "how has the rate changed this week". Use this skill whenever the user asks about dollars, euros, exchange rates, currency conversion, or any mention of USD, EUR, or курс.
- `@skill-e-documents` — This skill should be used when listing electronic documents (EDO) from bank inbox or outbox, viewing document signatures, downloading documents, or managing document exchange. Relevant for queries like "show my document inbox", "list outgoing documents for March", "check signature on document", or "download document from bank". Use this skill whenever the user mentions documents from bank, EDO, inbox/outbox, acts, invoices, or any bank document exchange.
- `@skill-encrypted-storage` — This skill should be used when encrypting or decrypting financial data files, rotating the storage passphrase, understanding where data is stored, or troubleshooting encryption errors. Relevant for queries like "encrypt my transaction data", "change my storage passphrase", "where are my bank files stored", or "decrypt accounts file". Use this skill whenever the user asks about data security, encryption, storing financial data, passphrase management, or where their data is saved.
- `@skill-examples` — This skill should be used when looking for complete workflow examples, step-by-step setup guides, architecture diagrams, or command references. Relevant for queries like "how do I set up multi-bank", "show me an example of the budget alert flow", "walk me through generating a report", or "show first-time setup guide". Use this skill whenever the user asks "how do I...", wants a walkthrough, needs a step-by-step guide, or is setting up the plugin for the first time.

Relevant for queries like "export my transactions to CSV", "generate a PDF report for last quarter", "export 90 days of data", or "create a monthly financial report".
