# dokploy-dev (OpenCode plugin)

Dokploy self-hosted PaaS development plugin (aligned with Dokploy v0.29.14). Deploy applications, provision 6 database types (Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, Redis, LibSQL), manage domains and Docker Compose stacks, AND debug failed deployments end-to-end — reads runtime logs of every container (including each container in a Docker Compose stack) over the API/MCP with tail/since/search, plus AI-powered log analysis (ai-analyzeLogs), Docker container introspection, Traefik diagnosis, and a guided recovery chain. Complete MCP/REST coverage: all 546 v0.29.14 operations across 50 categories indexed with params — covers forward-auth SSO domain protection, SCIM provisioning, build concurrency, and the rewritten @dokploy/cli (546 auto-generated commands incl. read-logs). Uses the official @dokploy/mcp server plus debugging-focused slash commands including /compose-logs.
