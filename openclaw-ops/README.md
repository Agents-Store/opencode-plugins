# openclaw-ops (OpenCode plugin)

Operations plugin for a fleet of self-hosted OpenClaw gateway instances running as Docker Compose projects on one host. Discovers every instance from the live Docker state (never from hard-coded paths), classifies it ok/degraded/down/alien, and runs day-two maintenance: health and liveness reporting, provider-auth triage (expired, emptied and shadowed OAuth profiles, shared-credential token sink), config surgery with snapshot and executable rollback, memory/embedding repair and reindexing, shared skills and plugins consolidation, Infisical secret-delivery audit by key name only, security audit, version-drift and channel-aware upgrades, and reference-instance cloning. Mutations are dry-run by default behind an eight-block plan, need --yes, and need a typed confirmation when irreversible. Secrets are reported as fingerprints, presence and expiry — never as values. File-based knowledge: no MCP server, no required environment variables, no stored credentials; the single optional variable OPENCLAW_OPS_CONFIG is an escape hatch for the fleet-config path, and deployment specifics live in that operator-owned config outside the repository.

## Install

Copy this directory's contents into your project (or `~/.config/opencode/` for a global install):

```bash
cp -r .opencode opencode.json AGENTS.md /path/to/your-project/
```

Skills under `.opencode/skills/` are discovered natively by OpenCode (native skill support, Feb 2026) — no manual registration needed.
