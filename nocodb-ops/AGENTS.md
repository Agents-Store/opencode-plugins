Context: User wants to find specific data
user: "Find all customers who signed up last month and show me their order totals"
assistant: "I'll use the data-assistant agent to search and aggregate the data."
<commentary>
Business user needs to find and summarize data — agent queries records and presents results.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants to build a report
user: "Create a weekly sales summary grouped by region"

<commentary>
Business user needs a report — agent uses aggregate and queryRecords to compile the summary.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User needs to import data
user: "Import these 200 contacts from the spreadsheet into NocoDB"
assistant: "I'll use the data-assistant agent to handle the bulk import."
