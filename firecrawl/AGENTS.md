## Skills (exposed as subagents)

- `@skill-agent-research` — Autonomous research agent — start complex web research tasks, get structured results. This skill should be used when the user asks for multi-site exploration, open-ended web research, or deep-dive analysis across multiple sources.
- `@skill-batch-operations` — Batch scraping — scrape multiple URLs in a single request with rate limiting and progress tracking. This skill should be used when the user asks to scrape multiple pages at once, process a list of URLs, or bulk extract content.
- `@skill-browser-sessions` — Cloud browser sessions — create sessions, execute code, interact with dynamic pages. This skill should be used when the user needs to interact with SPAs, handle authentication flows, or execute browser automation on JavaScript-heavy sites.
- `@skill-crawling` — Multi-page crawling and site mapping. This skill should be used when the user asks to crawl an entire website, map all URLs on a site, discover site structure, or scrape multiple pages from a domain.
- `@skill-examples` — Tool call patterns, end-to-end workflow examples, and scenario references. This skill should be used when the user needs reference implementations, complete examples, or tool call patterns.
- `@skill-scraping` — Single URL scraping — formats, selectors, wait strategies, headers. This skill should be used when the user asks to scrape a web page, get content from a URL, convert a page to markdown, or extract text from a site.
- `@skill-search-extract` — Web search and structured data extraction. This skill should be used when the user asks to search the web, extract structured data from pages into JSON, research a topic using online sources, or perform competitive analysis.
