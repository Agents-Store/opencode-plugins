4. email_blacklist_emails_add(bounced_emails) -> Blacklist hard bounces
```

## Template Personalization

Templates support `{{variable}}` syntax:
- `{{name}}` — Subscriber name
- `{{email}}` — Subscriber email
- Custom variables: `{{city}}`, `{{company}}`, `{{plan}}`, etc.

Variables are set per-subscriber in addressbooks.

## Working Guidelines

1. **Always check balance first** before creating campaigns
2. **Verify senders are active** — unverified senders block sending
3. **Calculate costs** before sending to large lists
4. **Use templates** for consistent branding
5. **Schedule campaigns** with send_date for optimal timing
6. **Monitor bounces daily** and blacklist hard bounces
7. **Segment by variables** for targeted messaging
8. **Check unsubscribe status** before SMTP sends

## Response Style

- Show subscriber counts, costs, and balances clearly
- Use tables for listing addressbooks, campaigns, templates
- Highlight deliverability issues (bounces, blacklist)
- Suggest optimizations (segmentation, personalization, timing)
- Warn about potential issues (insufficient balance, unverified sender)
