# dify-ops

> Dify self-hosted update operations plugin. Pull upstream changes, merge into local dev branch, sync .env variables, detect Docker project names, and rebuild containers for Dify Docker deployments.

Canonical: https://github.com/agents-store/claude-public-plugins/tree/main/plugins/dify-ops

## Skills (exposed as subagents)

- `@skill-dify-docker-architecture` — Dify Docker Compose deployment architecture — services, container naming, directory layout, .env.example structure, and Docker project name conventions. Use when working with Dify Docker setup, understanding container services, debugging container issues, or needing to know the Dify directory structure. Triggers on "dify docker", "dify containers", "dify services", "dify architecture", "dify compose".

- `@skill-env-sync` — Synchronize .env with .env.example for Dify Docker deployments — detect new variables, add missing ones with default values, preserve existing customizations. Use when syncing env variables, checking for new Dify configuration variables, comparing .env.example vs .env, "env sync", "new env variables", "missing environment variables", or after pulling Dify updates.

- `@skill-examples` — End-to-end scenario walkthroughs for updating self-hosted Dify. Use when the user asks for "dify update example", "how to update dify", "show me an update walkthrough", "dify upgrade guide", "step-by-step dify update", or needs a complete example of the update process.

- `@skill-update-workflow` — Git workflow for updating self-hosted Dify — fetch upstream, merge main into dev, handle conflicts, checkout specific tags. Use when updating Dify, merging upstream changes, handling merge conflicts in Dify, or switching to a specific Dify version/tag. Triggers on "update dify", "pull dify changes", "merge main into dev", "upgrade dify", "dify version".


## Agents

- `@dify-updater` — Dify self-hosted update operations agent. Handles updating Dify Docker deployments — pulling
upstream changes, merging into local dev branch, syncing environment variables, detecting
Docker project names, and rebuilding containers.

<example>
Context: User wants to update to latest version
user: "Update my Dify to the latest version"
assistant: "I'll check your current Dify state and pull the latest changes from upstream."
<commentary>
Standard update request — agent runs the full update workflow: fetch, merge, env sync, rebuild.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants a specific version
user: "Update Dify to version 0.15.0"
assistant: "I'll fetch tags and merge version 0.15.0 into your dev branch."
<commentary>
Tagged release update — agent verifies tag exists, merges into dev, handles conflicts.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants to check status
user: "Check if my Dify needs updating"
assistant: "I'll check your current version against upstream and report the status."
<commentary>
Read-only check — agent compares local commit with origin/main and reports.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User has merge conflicts
user: "I have merge conflicts after updating Dify"
assistant: "I'll look at the conflicted files and help you resolve them."
<commentary>
Conflict resolution — agent lists conflicted files, shows diffs, recommends resolution strategy.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants env sync only
user: "Sync my Dify .env with the latest .env.example"
assistant: "I'll compare your .env against .env.example and add any missing variables."
<commentary>
Standalone env sync — agent diffs the two files and appends missing variables.
</commentary>
</example>


## Commands

- `/status` — Show current Dify instance status — git branch, version, container health, .env sync state
- `/update` — Update self-hosted Dify — pull upstream, merge into dev, sync .env, rebuild Docker containers
