## How tool references work

Plugin files use `~~capability` as a placeholder for whatever tool handles that action. For example, `~~search` means "use any available web search tool" — the agent tries providers in fallback order until one succeeds.

Plugins are **tool-agnostic** — they describe workflows in terms of actions (`~~search`, `~~scrape`, `~~crawl`) rather than specific tool names. The plugin ships no MCP server of its own: it uses whatever search and scrape servers are installed.

`web-search-dev` bundles Exa, Firecrawl, Jina and Perplexity, and is declared in this plugin's `dependencies`. When you install this plugin from the marketplace, Claude Code also installs and enables `web-search-dev` at the same scope (a bare dependency name resolves against the same marketplace). A copy loaded with `--plugin-dir` or copied by hand does not pull it in — install it yourself. You can also bring any other server that provides these capabilities — the fallback chains below simply skip tools that are not in your tool list.

Tool names in the chains are the bare names (`read_url`, `firecrawl_scrape`). Servers installed through `web-search-dev` register them as `mcp__plugin_web-search-dev_<server>__<tool>` with the servers `jina`, `exa`, `firecrawl`, `perplexity`. Argument shapes and the full tool lists live in `web-search-dev` (`mcp-patterns` skill, `references/*-tools.md`) and in `docs/tool_reference.md`.

## FALLBACK Rule

Every action goes through ALL available providers for that category, one by one:
1. Try provider 1 — if it works, use the result
2. If error, empty result, rate limit, or timeout — try provider 2
3. If error — try provider 3
4. Continue until one succeeds or all are exhausted
5. Only report "not found" when ALL providers failed

**Error from a provider = skip it, try the next one. Never stop at first failure.**

A tool that is not in your tool list (a server not installed, an opt-in tool not enabled, a hosted tier without an API key) counts as an error — skip it silently and note it in Methodology.

### Notes on the chains

- **`~~batch_search` / `~~batch_scrape`** — Jina takes up to 5 queries in `query` and up to 5 URLs in `url`; every item runs concurrently in one call. `search_arxiv` and `search_ssrn` take the same array.
- **Targeted read** — `read_url` with `question` (and `topk`, default 1) returns only the passages that answer it. It costs a fraction of a full page read. Use it for READ by default; read a page in full only for exact quotes, tables, or when the passages are not enough. `question` and `topk` belong to `read_url`: `web_fetch_exa` and plain `firecrawl_scrape` fall back to full pages, so select the relevant passages yourself — or call `firecrawl_scrape` with `formats: ["query"]` once per URL to keep the targeted mode.
- **`web_fetch_exa`** truncates each page to 3000 characters unless you pass `maxCharacters`; the chains pass 20000.
- **`~~extract`** — `firecrawl_scrape` takes plain-string `formats` (`["json"]`); the schema goes in `jsonOptions`. One call per URL. For URLs you do not know yet, or data spread across several sites, `firecrawl_agent` returns a job id — poll `firecrawl_agent_status` every 15–30 seconds until `completed` or `failed`, and set `maxCredits`.
- **`~~academic_search`** — `firecrawl_research_search_papers` covers PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv and arXiv; `firecrawl_research_read_paper` returns the passages of one paper that answer a `question`; `firecrawl_research_related_papers` walks the citation graph (`mode`: `similar`, `citers`, `references`). Jina covers arXiv and SSRN as the next step.
- **`~~code_search`** — `firecrawl_developer_search` searches repositories, GitHub issues, merged PRs, READMEs and docs; `skills: "only"` limits it to agent-skill files. Exa has no code-search tool; `web_search_advanced_exa` is opt-in.
- **`~~deep_agent`** — runs for minutes and spends credits. Use it only for depth `deep`, as an extra pass next to the normal chain, never as the only source.
- **`~~answer`** — a short answer with numbered citations. `perplexity_ask` (preset `fast`) for facts and summaries, `perplexity_reason` (`medium`) for comparisons and analysis. `perplexity_search`, the Perplexity tool inside `~~search`, returns ranked links with snippets and no synthesis.
- **Perplexity** — `perplexity_search` takes `query`; `perplexity_ask`, `perplexity_reason` and `perplexity_research` take `messages` (`[{role, content}]`). They run on the Perplexity Agent API presets `fast`, `medium` and `high`.

## General workflow

```
Step 1: SEARCH — find pages on the internet
  → Use ~~search on every available provider, one by one
  → First success = take the URLs
  → Provider error = skip, next provider

Step 2: SCRAPE — read the found pages
  → Use ~~scrape on every available provider, one by one
  → First success = take the content
  → Provider error = skip, next provider
```

This same pattern applies to every capability: answer, crawl, extract, academic_search, code_search, deep_agent.

## Utility tools (unique per provider, no fallback)

| Category | Tool | Provider |
|----------|------|----------|
| Relevance ranking | `sort_by_relevance` | Jina |
| Deduplication (text) | `deduplicate_strings` | Jina |
| PDF figures, tables, equations | `extract_pdf` | Jina |
| Screenshots | `capture_screenshot_url` (pass `return_url: true`) | Jina |
| Page date detection | `guess_datetime_url` | Jina |
| Image search | `search_images` (pass `return_url: true`) | Jina |
| Current time and location | `primer` | Jina |
| Site URL map | `firecrawl_map` | Firecrawl |
| Browser automation | `firecrawl_interact`, `firecrawl_interact_stop` | Firecrawl |

There are no tools for query expansion, text classification or BibTeX search: planning queries and classifying content are steps the model performs itself.
