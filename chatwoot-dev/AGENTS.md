Full REST API coverage (Application, Platform, and Public/Client APIs) with bundled OpenAPI specs, official chatwoot CLI recipes, webhook & agent-bot automation, and troubleshooting for developers building on Chatwoot. Authenticates with the api_access_token header via CHATWOOT_API_KEY against CHATWOOT_BASE_URL.

## Skills (exposed as subagents)

- `@skill-api-reference` — This skill should be used when the user asks for "Chatwoot API endpoints", "Chatwoot REST API", "Chatwoot curl examples", "Chatwoot Application/Platform/Public API", "Chatwoot API documentation", or needs specific HTTP endpoint, request, or response details for Chatwoot.
- `@skill-cli-recipes` — This skill should be used when the user asks about the "Chatwoot CLI", "chatwoot command line", "chatwoot convs/conv/contact commands", "triage Chatwoot from the terminal", "run Chatwoot in CI", or needs ready-to-use `chatwoot` CLI commands, the noun/verb grammar, output-format rules, or safety guidance for customer-visible writes.
- `@skill-examples` — This skill should be used when the user wants a worked, end-to-end Chatwoot example — "show me a full Chatwoot integration", "seed a conversation via the API", "build a Chatwoot bot example", "bulk import contacts", or "triage Chatwoot from the terminal" — combining setup, the REST API, the CLI, and webhooks into a complete scenario.
- `@skill-setup` — This skill should be used when the user asks to "set up Chatwoot API", "get a Chatwoot access token", "configure CHATWOOT_API_KEY", "install the Chatwoot CLI", "connect to Chatwoot", "verify Chatwoot is working", or needs to obtain credentials and confirm REST API / CLI access to a Chatwoot account (cloud or self-hosted).
- `@skill-troubleshoot` — This skill should be used when the user hits "Chatwoot API errors", "Chatwoot 401/403/404", "Chatwoot CLI not working", "Chatwoot webhook signature mismatch", "Chatwoot token not authorized", or needs to diagnose and fix problems with the Chatwoot API, CLI, or webhooks.
- `@skill-webhooks-automation` — This skill should be used when the user wants to "set up a Chatwoot webhook", "verify a Chatwoot webhook signature", "build a Chatwoot agent bot", "handle Chatwoot events", "create an automation rule", or build event-driven integrations and bots on top of Chatwoot (webhooks, automation rules, agent bots, integration hooks).

## Agents

- `@chatwoot-assistant` — Use this agent when the user needs help building with or operating Chatwoot — writing REST API integration code, choosing the right API family (Application / Platform / Public), debugging api_access_token auth, building agent bots and webhook handlers, automating conversation routing, or scripting the chatwoot CLI.

<example>
Context: User is writing an integration against the Chatwoot API.
user: "Write a function that fetches all open conversations in inbox 5 and posts a summary reply."
assistant: "I'll use the chatwoot-assistant agent to build the integration and pick the right endpoints/auth."
<commentary>Developer needs Chatwoot API integration code with correct auth and pagination.</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User is building a bot.
user: "Help me build a Chatwoot agent bot that auto-replies to new messages and verifies the webhook signature."
assistant: "I'll use the chatwoot-assistant agent to wire up the webhook receiver, signature check, and reply loop."
<commentary>Bot + webhook work spanning webhooks-automation and the Application API.</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants to triage from the terminal.
user: "Show me how to find and resolve all spam-labelled conversations with the chatwoot CLI."
assistant: "I'll use the chatwoot-assistant agent to script the CLI triage safely."
<commentary>CLI scripting where customer-visible writes must be confirmed.</commentary>
</example>


## Commands

- `/api-call` — Build (and optionally run) an authenticated Chatwoot REST API request — picks the correct API family and auth header, reads GETs freely, and confirms before any write.
- `/troubleshoot` — Diagnose a Chatwoot API / CLI / webhook problem — run read-only connectivity, auth, and scope checks against the configured instance and report the fix.
