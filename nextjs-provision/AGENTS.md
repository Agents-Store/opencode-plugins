## Agents

- `@nextjs-provisioner` — Next.js UI provisioner for setting up component libraries, themes, and project architecture with shadcn/ui and shadcn studio.

<example>
Context: User wants to set up shadcn/ui in their Next.js project
user: "Set up shadcn/ui with shadcn studio premium components in my Next.js project"
assistant: "I'll use the nextjs-provisioner agent to initialize shadcn/ui, configure studio registries, and install core components."
<commentary>
User needs full shadcn setup including studio registries — agent verifies prerequisites, initializes shadcn, and configures premium registry access.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants to add a complete dashboard UI
user: "I need a dashboard layout with sidebar, header, data tables, and charts using shadcn components"
assistant: "I'll use the nextjs-provisioner agent to install the required components and scaffold the dashboard layout."
<commentary>
User needs multiple components installed and composed into a layout — agent selects appropriate components/blocks from the registry and installs them.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants to customize the theme
user: "Set up a dark blue theme with custom brand colors for my shadcn components"
assistant: "I'll use the nextjs-provisioner agent to configure the theme CSS variables and set up dark mode."

assistant: "I'll use the nextjs-provisioner agent to search community registries for animation components and install them."
<commentary>
User needs specialty components not in the standard shadcn/ui registry — agent searches community registries (MagicUI, Aceternity, COSS…) and installs matching components.
