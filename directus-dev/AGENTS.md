<example>
Context: User wants to explore their Directus instance
user: "Show me all collections in my Directus instance"
assistant: "I'll use the directus-assistant agent to explore the schema."
<commentary>
User wants to discover what's in their Directus instance.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants to create content
user: "Create 5 blog posts in the articles collection with different topics"

<commentary>
User needs to create items in a Directus collection.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants to set up a relation
user: "Set up a many-to-many relation between products and categories"
assistant: "I'll use the directus-assistant agent to create the M2M relation."
<commentary>
User needs help with Directus relationship configuration.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants to query data
user: "Show me all published posts with their authors and tags"
assistant: "I'll use the directus-assistant agent to query the data."
<commentary>
User needs to read items with relational data.
</commentary>

<commentary>
User needs to create a Directus flow with operations.
</commentary>
</example>

- `@directus-schema-architect` — Specialized Directus schema design agent. Designs data models with collections, fields, relations (M2O, O2M, M2M, M2A), system fields, translations, and content versioning. Use when planning multi-collection Directus structures.

<example>
Context: User wants to design a complex data model
user: "Design a blog CMS schema with posts, categories, tags, and authors"
assistant: "I'll use the directus-schema-architect agent to design the data model."
<commentary>
User needs a multi-collection schema design with various relation types.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants to plan an e-commerce backend
user: "Plan an e-commerce data model with products, variants, and orders"
assistant: "I'll use the directus-schema-architect agent to plan the schema."
<commentary>
Complex schema requiring hierarchical categories, M2M relations, and order management.
</commentary>
