## Skills (exposed as subagents)

- `@skill-api-reference` — This skill should be used when the user asks for "Jira API endpoints", "Confluence API endpoints", "Jira/Confluence REST API", "Atlassian curl examples", "the exact method/parameters" for any Jira or Confluence resource, or needs HTTP details for issues, JQL search, comments, worklogs, attachments, links, projects, versions, components, fields, screens, workflows, statuses, users, groups, permissions, schemes, dashboards, filters, plans; or Confluence pages, blog posts, spaces, comments, attachments, labels, content properties. Indexes the full per-domain endpoint catalog plus the bundled OpenAPI specs.
- `@skill-confluence-operations` — This skill should be used when the user wants to do Confluence work — "create a Confluence page", "update a page", "edit a wiki page", "create a child page", "create a space", "list spaces", "comment on a page", "add a label", "attach a file in Confluence", or any everyday Confluence operation. Provides plain-language playbooks that drive the Confluence Cloud REST API v2.
- `@skill-examples` — This skill should be used when the user wants a worked end-to-end Jira/Confluence example or walkthrough — "show me a full Jira workflow", "example of planning an epic with stories", "issue lifecycle example", "build a Confluence space via the API", "generate release notes in Confluence from Jira", or wants to see several Atlassian API calls chained together for a real scenario.
- `@skill-jira-operations` — This skill should be used when the user wants to do Jira work — "create a Jira issue", "search Jira", "run a JQL query", "transition an issue", "move an issue to Done", "assign an issue", "comment on an issue", "log work / log time", "create a Jira project", "create a version/release", "add an attachment", or any everyday Jira operation. Provides plain-language playbooks that drive the Jira Cloud REST API v3.
- `@skill-setup` — This skill should be used when the user wants to "connect to Jira", "connect to Confluence", "authenticate with Atlassian", "set up Jira/Confluence access", "use my Atlassian API token", or before running any Jira or Confluence REST API call. Establishes Atlassian Cloud Basic auth (email + API token) and the global conventions both APIs share (base paths, headers, Jira startAt/maxResults vs Confluence cursor pagination, ADF/storage body formats, accountId).
- `@skill-troubleshoot` — This skill should be used when a Jira or Confluence REST API call fails or behaves unexpectedly — "Jira/Confluence returns 401 / 403 / 404 / 400 / 409 / 429", "Atlassian API token not working", "ADF error / body must be ADF", "page won't update / version conflict", "can't find the page/issue", "wrong base URL", "CQL not working in v2", "boards/sprints endpoint not found", or any Atlassian error response. Maps symptoms to causes and fixes.

## Agents

- `@atlassian-assistant` — Use this agent when the user needs to run Jira or Confluence Cloud operations — creating, editing, transitioning, assigning, commenting on, or searching issues (JQL); managing projects, versions, components, fields, workflows, and schemes; logging work; or creating and updating Confluence pages (versioned), spaces, comments, attachments, and labels — by driving the Atlassian Cloud REST APIs (Jira v3 + Confluence v2) with curl.

<example>
Context: User wants to create a Jira issue.
user: "Create a bug in PROJ: 'Login times out after 30s' with a short description."
assistant: "I'll use the atlassian-assistant agent to create the issue with an ADF description via POST /issue."
<commentary>
Jira v3 rich text is ADF JSON, not markdown — the agent builds the ADF body and creates the issue.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants a JQL report.
user: "What's still open under epic PROJ-100 and who owns each one?"
assistant: "I'll use the atlassian-assistant agent to run a JQL search on the epic's children and table the results."
<commentary>
POST /search/jql with jql "parent = PROJ-100 AND statusCategory != Done" — reporting from search.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants cross-product publishing.
user: "Make a Confluence release-notes page from the issues we shipped in 1.2.0."
assistant: "I'll use the atlassian-assistant agent to JQL the done issues in that fixVersion and build a Confluence page from them."
<commentary>
Jira search/jql → format → Confluence POST /pages — one token, both products.
</commentary>
</example>
