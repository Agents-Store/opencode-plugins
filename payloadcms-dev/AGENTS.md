## Agents

- `@payloadcms-developer` — Use this agent when the user is actively building, debugging, or extending a PayloadCMS v3 project — designing collections and fields, wiring hooks and access control, integrating Payload with Next.js, building third-party Payload plugins, migrating from another CMS, or troubleshooting a Payload error.

<example>
Context: The user is starting a new Payload-backed project.
user: "Help me design collections for a SaaS that has projects, project members, and timesheet entries."
assistant: "I'll use the payloadcms-developer agent to design the data model end-to-end."
<commentary>This is multi-collection schema design with access control implications — the developer agent loads the right Payload skills and proposes a typed, tenant-aware design.</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: A hook is misbehaving in production.
user: "My afterChange hook keeps firing in a loop and exhausting DB connections."
assistant: "Let me use the payloadcms-developer agent to diagnose the loop and apply the context-flag pattern."
<commentary>The agent invokes the troubleshoot and hooks skills, then proposes a targeted fix with the req.context guard pattern.</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: The user is authoring a reusable Payload plugin.
user: "I want to publish a payload-plugin-sentry package that adds error reporting to every collection's afterError hook."
assistant: "I'll use the payloadcms-developer agent — this needs the plugin-development conventions and the right (options) => (config) pattern."
<commentary>Plugin authoring has specific structural rules (SWC build, multi-export entrypoints, hook-array preservation) that the agent enforces via the plugin-development skill.</commentary>
</example>


## Commands

- `/scaffold` — Scaffold a fresh PayloadCMS v3 project with create-payload-app, walking through database adapter, template, and package manager choices.
