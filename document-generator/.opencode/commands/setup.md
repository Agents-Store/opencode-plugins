# Document Generator Setup

Run the onboarding interview to configure document generation preferences.

## Steps

1. **Check existing preferences:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/.document-generator/preferences.json 2>/dev/null
   ```
   If preferences already exist, ask the user if they want to update them or start fresh.

2. **Check dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd <plugin_dir> && node scripts/check_deps.js
   ```
   If any dependencies are missing, show the user what needs to be installed and ask for permission.

3. **Run the onboarding interview** from the **user-preferences** skill:
   - Ask about preferred document style (show 5+ presets with descriptions)
   - Ask about default language (en, uk, de, fr, es)
   - Optionally collect company information (name, address, phone, email, website, registration/tax ID)
   - Optionally collect company logo (file path → validate → convert to base64 → store)
   - Optionally set formatting preferences (paper size A4/Letter, currency symbol, date format)

4. **Save preferences** to `~/.document-generator/preferences.json`

5. **Confirm setup is complete** and show a summary of what was configured.

## Notes

- This command can be run at any time to update preferences
- Use the **user-preferences** skill for the full onboarding flow details
- Preferences are stored at `~/.document-generator/preferences.json`
- Logos are stored at `~/.document-generator/logos/`
