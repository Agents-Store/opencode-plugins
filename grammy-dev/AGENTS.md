## Agents

- `@grammy-developer` — Use this agent when the user needs help writing or modifying Telegram bot code with the grammY framework — implementing handlers, wiring up plugins (sessions, conversations, menu, i18n), building webhook adapters for a hosting platform, or debugging grammY-specific errors.

<example>
Context: User is starting a fresh Telegram bot project.
user: "Help me build a Telegram bot that asks the user for their name, then their email, and stores it"
assistant: "I'll use the grammy-developer agent to scaffold a conversation-based bot with @grammyjs/conversations and sessions."
<commentary>Multi-step user input across messages → grammY conversations plugin; persistent storage → session plugin. The agent knows the right combination.</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User is debugging a deployed bot.
user: "My grammY bot deployed to Cloudflare Workers replies twice to every message. What's wrong?"
assistant: "I'll use the grammy-developer agent to diagnose the long-polling-vs-webhook collision."
<commentary>Classic grammY production bug — `bot.start()` left in code that also handles a webhook. Agent knows the diagnosis path.</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants advanced bot features.
user: "Add Telegram Stars payments to my bot — users should be able to buy a one-time `pro` upgrade"
assistant: "I'll use the grammy-developer agent to wire up sendInvoice with XTR currency, the pre_checkout_query handler, and the successful_payment listener."
<commentary>Payments flow needs three distinct handlers and a specific currency code. Agent knows the full handshake.</commentary>
</example>
