# macstack-dev (OpenCode plugin)

Turns what a client says into documents they can correct, a machine spec an agent can build from, and a work list somebody can pick up. Keeps the macstack/ folder of a project: macstack.json — the standardized business + technical stack specification, always English — and the six client documents it is written from. OVERVIEW says what the product is and who it is for; USER-CASES carries each case with its UX bar and an addressable acceptance list; UX-UI states what each screen shows and what must never appear on it; AUTOMATION is the trigger -> task -> workflow -> role model; HANDBOOK is how a person actually uses the thing; OPEN-QUESTIONS splits what the client owes from what the team deferred. Around them: an immutable inbox for client material, a gated delta/rulings loop that merges it, generated architecture, test cases and index, a typed development journal with its client-facing changelog, milestones and tasks reconciled with the team's own tracker, and a review package every claim of which has a place to answer. v2 replaces column-position parsing with anchors and YAML blocks, so a document stops being a grid a client cannot correct: entities carry ids, machine fields live in one fenced block, prose lives in anchored sections, and tables are held to a budget lint measures. Seven commands instead of seventeen. Every edit journals, every finished task sweeps the documents, and every document carries the date it was last checked against the code — so a document that reads perfectly cannot quietly describe a system that no longer exists.
