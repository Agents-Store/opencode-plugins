# macstack-dev (OpenCode plugin)

MACSTACK dev plugin for Agents Store. Creates and maintains the macstack/ folder of a Claude project: macstack.json — the standardized business + technical stack specification — plus the working documents around it: user cases per role, test cases derived from their acceptance bullets, milestones and tasks reconciled with the team's own task tracker, a typed development journal and its client-facing changelog, business logic in plain words, the decision log with cost-if-wrong, open questions split into what the client owes and what the team deferred, and an immutable inbox for client material. Init in existing projects, generate from scratch (result-first), discover context plugins and prototypes, scaffold project files in the prototype → stack plugins → dev plugins order, merge incoming client edits through a gated delta/rulings loop, report where the project stands and what to run next, wire Infisical env, install best-practice rules and commands. Renders ROLES.md (who does what and what starts it) and ARCHITECTURE.md (how the project is built) from the spec so they cannot drift, builds a client review package every acceptance bullet of which has a place to write, and gives every living document a journal and a shelf life so a document that reads perfectly cannot quietly describe a system that no longer exists. v1.8 folds the folder into four: client/ — what a human writes and the client reads, and which is now the SOURCE of the spec's business half; generated/ — what the plugin builds; inbox/ — what the client sent; history/ — journals, decisions, deltas, reviews, handoffs. Adds two authored client documents: ROLES-AND-TASKS.md (trigger → task → workflow, in tables a client can correct) and SCREENS.md (what is on each screen and what must NOT be visible there).
