# macstack-dev

> MACSTACK dev plugin for Agents Store. Creates and maintains the macstack/ folder of a Claude project: macstack.json — the standardized business + technical stack specification — plus the working documents around it: user cases per role, test cases derived from their acceptance bullets, milestones and tasks reconciled with the team's own task tracker, a typed development journal and its client-facing changelog, business logic in plain words, the decision log with cost-if-wrong, open questions split into what the client owes and what the team deferred, and an immutable inbox for client material. Init in existing projects, generate from scratch (result-first), discover context plugins and prototypes, scaffold project files in the prototype → stack plugins → dev plugins order, merge incoming client edits through a gated delta/rulings loop, report where the project stands and what to run next, wire Infisical env, install best-practice rules and commands. Renders ROLES.md (who does what and what starts it) and ARCHITECTURE.md (how the project is built) from the spec so they cannot drift, builds a client review package every acceptance bullet of which has a place to write, and gives every living document a journal and a shelf life so a document that reads perfectly cannot quietly describe a system that no longer exists. v1.8 folds the folder into four: client/ — what a human writes and the client reads, and which is now the SOURCE of the spec's business half; generated/ — what the plugin builds; inbox/ — what the client sent; history/ — journals, decisions, deltas, reviews, handoffs. Adds two authored client documents: ROLES-AND-TASKS.md (trigger → task → workflow, in tables a client can correct) and SCREENS.md (what is on each screen and what must NOT be visible there). v1.9 closes the last link of the client loop: plan-changes turns the user cases nobody scheduled and no audit confirmed into task entries carrying files, acceptance and a pointer back to the requirement — the handoff a planning session reads instead of being told the requirement again.

## Skills

Automatically discovered by OpenCode from `.opencode/skills/` (native skill support, Feb 2026) — loaded on demand from their descriptions below, no manual invocation needed:

- **best-practices** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "install best practice rules", "set up project rules", "add project rules and commands", "set up project conventions", or scaffold-project reaches the rules step. Installs the proven MACSTACK rule set (.claude/rules) and core commands into a project.
- **changelog** — This skill should be used when the user wants to "write a changelog", "log what I did", "record today's work", "what shipped", "что сделали", "лог разработки", "записать в журнал", "release notes", "what changed for the client", "закрыть веху", "что нового в релизе", "cut a release", write a `work` or `release` entry to `macstack/log.md`, or curate `log.md` into `macstack/CHANGELOG.md`. Never used for `intake` or `merge` entries — those stay owned by `docs-merge`.
- **client-package** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "send the cases to the client", "give the client something to edit", "собрать пакет для клиента", "отдать клиенту на согласование", "prepare the user cases for review", or needs the outbound half of the client loop — turning USER-CASES.md and BUSINESS-LOGIC.md into one file a client can annotate and send back.
- **discover-context** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "find plugins for this stack", "discover context for the project", "which plugins should I install", "find a prototype", "pick a stack prototype", or when init-project/generate-stack need context.plugins and prototype candidates. Searches Agents Store plugins and stackmakers-ai prototypes on GitHub.
- **docs-merge** — This skill should be used when the user says "client sent edits", "merge client feedback", "клиент прислал правки", "разобрать правки", "improve the user cases", "new spec from the client", "process the inbox", "what changed in the client's document", "apply the delta", pastes new client material into chat, or drops a file into macstack/inbox/. Runs the full intake → delta → gate → ruling → apply → log loop against the macstack/ folder standard — never edits USER-CASES.md, BUSINESS-LOGIC.md or macstack.json directly from raw client material.
- **docs-migrate** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "migrate docs to macstack", "move the project documents", "перенести docs в macstack", "standardize an existing project's documents", "we already have a docs folder", "move macstack.json into the folder", or wants an organically-grown `docs/` folder (with `macstack.json` still at the repo root) relocated into the standard `macstack/` layout. Disabled for model-invocation: this is a one-time, destructive, multi-gate procedure that must only run when a human explicitly asks for it, never inferred from context.
- **examples** — This skill should be used when the user asks for "macstack examples", "show a full macstack.json example", "how does a complete macstack.json look", "walk me through a macstack scenario", or needs an end-to-end scenario walkthrough for this plugin's skills.
- **feedback** — This skill should be used when the user reports a problem with macstack-dev or the MACSTACK standard — "this skill did the wrong thing", "the schema is missing a field", "the passport for X is wrong", "send macstack feedback", "improve the schema based on my edit", "fix the macstack plugin" — and the fix must land in the right source (plugin, schema repo, or registry repo).
- **generate-stack** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "generate macstack.json from scratch", "design a stack for…", "pick software and architecture for my need", "create a stack spec from my request", or describes a business need without an existing codebase. Designs goals, results, processes, workflows, software and architecture result-first and produces a validated macstack.json.
- **infisical-env** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "set up Infisical for this project", "create .infisical.json", "pull the env keys", "wire the env", "sync secrets", or scaffold-project reaches the env step. Creates .infisical.json, pulls .env.prod/.env.dev, ensures every key from macstack.json resources.accesses exists, and installs the mandatory secrets scripts and commands.
- **init-project** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "create macstack.json in this project", "add macstack.json", "init macstack", "describe this existing project as macstack.json", or an existing codebase has no macstack.json. Audits the existing project and produces a validated macstack.json draft.
- **lint** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "validate macstack.json", "lint macstack", "check the stack spec", "verify macstack.json integrity", or after any skill of this plugin writes/edits macstack.json. Validates against the bundled JSON Schema and the referential-integrity rules.
- **plan-changes** — This skill should be used when the user asks "what do we build next", "turn the requirements into tasks", "что надо сделать по кейсам", "спроектировать правки", "составить ТЗ по требованиям клиента", "which cases have no plan", or needs the bridge between what the client agreed must be true and what an agent will actually change in the code. Turns uncovered user cases into task entries carrying files, acceptance and a pointer back to the requirement.
- **project-docs** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "create the macstack folder", "set up project docs", "where do user cases live", "add USER-CASES.md", "standardize the project documents", "repair the macstack folder", mentions `macstack/`, OPEN-QUESTIONS, DECISIONS, the client inbox or the document log — and BEFORE any other skill reads or writes anything under `macstack/`. Defines the folder standard: layout, path resolution, ID spaces, section anchors, the language rule and the immutability guardrails.
- **render-docs** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "render the generated docs", "rebuild ROLES.md", "update ARCHITECTURE.md", "пересобрать документы", "обновить роли и архитектуру", when lint reports rule 12.18 (a generated document differs from its source), or after any change to macstack.json's roles, processes, workflows, triggers, software, entities or context.plugins. Rebuilds the documents whose source of truth is the spec, not themselves.
- **scaffold-project** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "scaffold the project from macstack.json", "create the project working files", "generate project files from the spec", "build the project from macstack.json", or after a macstack.json is validated and the working tree must be built. Creates project files strictly in the prototype → stack plugins → dev plugins order.
- **setup** — This skill should be used when the user asks "what is macstack.json", "set up macstack", "check macstack setup", "verify macstack.json", "explain the macstack standard", or before any other macstack-dev skill runs in a project for the first time. Explains the standard, locates the schema and category registry, and verifies tooling.
- **status** — This skill should be used when the user asks "project status", "where are we", "что сейчас в проекте", "на чём остановились", "what should I work on next", "что дальше", "покажи состояние", "am I on track", "what's blocking us", "status dashboard", "куда смотреть дальше", "что мешает", or wants a single-screen read of a macstack/ project's state before deciding what to do next.
- **sync-spec** — This skill should be used when the user says "client corrected the tables", "sync the spec with the documents", "синхронизировать спеку с документами", "клиент поправил роли", "the roles document and macstack.json disagree", when lint reports that the business half of macstack.json differs from client/ROLES-AND-TASKS.md, or after anyone edits the task, trigger or screen tables. Reconciles macstack.json against the documents the client actually reads.
- **tasks** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "add a task", "what's left to do", "что осталось сделать", "завести задачу", "план работ", "backlog", "milestone status", "sync tasks with the tracker", "синхронизировать задачи", "what should I work on next", "какая веха дальше", "add to the backlog", "отметить задачу выполненной", "block this on", or mentions TASKS.md, milestones, M<n>-T<n> ids, or the team's task tracker. Owns TASKS.md — milestones, tasks, backlog — and its bidirectional reconcile with whatever tracker the project is bound to, without ever naming a specific product.
- **test-cases** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "make test cases", "составить тест-кейсы", "generate tests from the user cases", "как это проверять", "написать сценарии проверки", "acceptance checklist", "what do we test for C-04", "обновить тест-кейсы под новую версию кейсов", or wants a QA/acceptance plan derived from USER-CASES.md. Derives TEST-CASES.md from the acceptance bullets of USER-CASES.md — one test per bullet, each tagged auto or manual — and keeps the two in step.
- **troubleshoot** — This skill should be used when the user reports "macstack lint fails", "prototype does not resolve", "env keys missing", "scaffold broke my files", "cross-stack reference does not work", or any macstack-dev skill errors out. Diagnoses the common failure modes of the macstack.json toolchain.

## Agents

- `@macstack-architect` — Use this agent when the user needs to design or evolve a macstack.json — generate a stack from a business request, audit an existing project into a spec, choose software/architecture/prototype, or decompose goals into results, processes and workflows.

<example>
Context: User describes a business need without a codebase
user: "Design a stack for an online school: payments, an LMS, email campaigns"
assistant: "I'll use the macstack-architect agent to design the stack result-first."
<commentary>
Business request → goals/results → processes → software selection → macstack.json draft.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Existing repo without a spec
user: "Describe this project as a macstack.json"
assistant: "I'll use the macstack-architect agent to audit the codebase and draft the spec."
<commentary>
Audit manifests/compose/.mcp.json → software/entities/workflows; ask the user only the business gaps.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Ambiguous software choice
user: "What should I pick for a CRM stack — NocoBase or Directus?"
assistant: "I'll use the macstack-architect agent to compare against the requirements and recommend."
<commentary>
The decision needs the result-first framework and the Agentic IT Ready criteria.
</commentary>
</example>
