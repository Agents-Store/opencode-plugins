description: Create macstack.json in an existing project (audit codebase → validated spec)
---

Use the macstack-dev:setup skill to verify tooling, then the macstack-dev:init-project
skill to audit the existing project ($ARGUMENTS or current directory) and produce a
validated macstack.json. Invoke macstack-dev:project-docs to create the `macstack/`
folder. Finish with macstack-dev:lint and add the CLAUDE.md "Stack Specification"
section. Report: what was derived from code, what came from the user, and the
remaining open questions.
