description: Validate the spec and the documents, report where the project stands and what to run next, or audit the implementation against the documents
---

Read-only in every mode. Nothing here writes to the spec or to a client document.

**Empty** — `macstack-dev:lint`, all three passes, then the status screen. One engine,
two ways of printing it: the dashboard is the lint findings ordered by cost of ignoring
them, not a second set of predicates with its own opinion.

**`--docs`** — pass 3 and the judgment checks only. Use it after editing documents and
before handing anything to a client.

**`--code`** — `macstack-dev:conformance`. Starts from a **case id**: does the
implementation do what this case promises? Writes one `audit` row per case into
`history/ledger.jsonl`. Those verdicts are what `/macstack-dev:plan` reads to tell real
work from a document nobody has checked — without them a gap report counts every case
the team already built.

**`--new`** — `macstack-dev:code-audit`. Starts from a **file** and asks the opposite
question: what is in the code that no document mentions? Enumerates the code by the
conventions the spec declares, then sorts every candidate into one of three lists —
not in the documents · not in the code · contradicts. Output is a proposal, never an
edit: what to do about a contradiction is the owner's ruling, and it is applied through
`/macstack-dev:intake`.

Both read the source tree and neither writes to it. Run `--code` when you want to know
whether the promises hold; `--new` when you suspect the code has moved on without the
documents. On a folder nobody has audited in months, run `--new` first: a verdict on a
case the documents never described is a verdict on the wrong question.

Report errors before warnings, and end with the single next command. If the spec fails
lint, say plainly that it must not be scaffolded from.
