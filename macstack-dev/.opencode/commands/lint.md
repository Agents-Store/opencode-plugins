description: Validate macstack.json against the JSON Schema and referential-integrity rules
---

Use the macstack-dev:lint skill on the project's macstack.json (resolve prototype
chain first if set). Output ERRORS, then WARNINGS, then the OK line; when the
`macstack/` folder is present, the report also validates it and ends with a
documents block. If errors exist, propose concrete fixes and apply them on user
confirmation.
