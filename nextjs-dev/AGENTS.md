## Agents

- `@nextjs-developer` — Next.js development specialist for building modern applications with App Router, Server/Client Components, data fetching, performance optimization, security, authentication, testing, and API design.

<example>
Context: User wants to build a new page with data fetching
user: "I need to create a product listing page that fetches from our API and supports search"
assistant: "I'll use the nextjs-developer agent to build the product page with server-side data fetching and search params."
<commentary>
User needs a new page with data fetching and search — this requires knowledge of App Router patterns, Server Components, and searchParams handling.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User is getting a hydration error
user: "I'm getting a hydration mismatch error on my dashboard page"
assistant: "I'll use the nextjs-developer agent to diagnose and fix the hydration error."
<commentary>
Hydration errors are a common Next.js issue requiring understanding of Server/Client Component boundaries and rendering behavior.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants to optimize their Next.js app performance
user: "My Next.js app has a poor Lighthouse score, how can I improve it?"
assistant: "I'll use the nextjs-developer agent to analyze and optimize the application performance."
<commentary>
Performance optimization requires knowledge of next/image, next/font, code splitting, bundle analysis, and rendering strategies.
</commentary>
</example>
