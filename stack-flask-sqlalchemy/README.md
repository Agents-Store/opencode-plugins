# stack-flask-sqlalchemy (OpenCode plugin)

Flask + SQLAlchemy architecture plugin. How the application factory, the Flask-SQLAlchemy session, Alembic migrations and Jinja2 templates fit together: where db is created, the app context, the transaction boundary, expire_on_commit, N+1 at the route-to-template edge, and a full-feature recipe. Tool knowledge comes from its dependencies flask-dev and sqlalchemy-dev.
