# mattermost-ops

> Mattermost collaboration ops plugin. Drive the full Mattermost REST API v4 by curl — users, teams, channels (public/private/DM/group), posts & threads, reactions, files, custom emoji, webhooks, slash commands, bots, OAuth apps, plus system administration: config, RBAC roles & schemes, LDAP/SAML groups, compliance, data retention, plugins, jobs, and analytics. Authenticates with MATTERMOST_ADMIN_USERNAME + MATTERMOST_ADMIN_PASSWORD to obtain a session token against MATTERMOST_API_URL.

## Skills (exposed as subagents)

- `@skill-api-reference` — This skill should be used when the user asks for "Mattermost API endpoints", "Mattermost REST API", "Mattermost curl examples", "Mattermost API documentation", the exact path/method for any Mattermost resource, or needs HTTP details for users, teams, channels, posts, reactions, files, emoji, webhooks, slash commands, bots, OAuth apps, system config, roles, schemes, groups, LDAP/SAML, compliance, or data retention. Index into the full per-domain endpoint catalog.
- `@skill-common-operations` — This skill should be used when the user wants to do collaboration work in Mattermost — "post a message to a channel", "send a DM in Mattermost", "create a channel", "add users to a team/channel", "deactivate a user", "create a team", "set up a webhook", "react to a post", or any everyday Mattermost operation. Provides plain-language workflows that drive the REST API and route to the exact endpoints.
- `@skill-examples` — This skill should be used when the user wants a worked end-to-end Mattermost example or walkthrough — "show me a full Mattermost workflow", "example of onboarding a team in Mattermost", "how do I broadcast a message to several channels via the API", "end-to-end channel management example", or wants to see several Mattermost API calls chained together for a real scenario.
- `@skill-setup` — This skill should be used when the user wants to "connect to Mattermost", "log into Mattermost", "authenticate with Mattermost", "get a Mattermost token", "set up Mattermost access", or before running any Mattermost REST API call. Establishes the session token (read from the login Token response header) and the global request conventions (base path, headers, pagination, rate limits).
- `@skill-troubleshoot` — This skill should be used when a Mattermost REST API call fails or behaves unexpectedly — "Mattermost returns 401 / 403 / 404 / 429", "Mattermost login fails", "I got no token after login", "can't find the channel/user", "pagination missing results", "permission denied", or any Mattermost error response. Maps symptoms to causes and fixes.

## Agents

- `@mattermost-assistant` — Use this agent when the user needs help running collaboration operations in Mattermost — managing users, teams, channels, posts & threads, reactions, files, custom emoji, webhooks, slash commands, bots, OAuth apps, or system administration (config, roles, schemes, groups, LDAP/SAML, compliance, data retention, plugins) — by driving the Mattermost REST API.

<example>
Context: User wants to post an announcement
user: "Post an announcement to #general in the Engineering team that the release is live"
assistant: "I'll use the mattermost-assistant agent to resolve the team and channel and post the message."
<commentary>
Resolve team/channel by name, then create the post — a core Mattermost ops flow.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants to stand up a workspace

<commentary>
Team + channel creation followed by membership management — a multi-step onboarding flow.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants an admin report
user: "Give me a report of total users, posts, and channel counts per team"
assistant: "I'll use the mattermost-assistant agent to gather the stats and analytics and format the report."
<commentary>
Reporting from stats and analytics endpoints (System Admin) — the agent aggregates and presents.
</commentary>
</example>
