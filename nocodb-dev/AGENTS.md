## Agents

- `@schema-architect` — Use this agent when the user needs to create or modify NocoDB schema — add tables, change field types, set up relations (link / lookup / rollup), build views, or wire webhooks.

<example>
Context: User wants to add a related table
user: "Add an Orders table linked to Customers, and put a Total field on it"
assistant: "I'll use the schema-architect agent to design and apply the schema change."
<commentary>
Cross-table relation work — agent discovers via MCP, plans the change, applies via CLI/API, and verifies.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants a Formula field
user: "Add a 'Days Open' formula on the Tickets table that subtracts CreatedAt from now"
assistant: "I'll use the schema-architect agent to add the Formula field."
<commentary>
Computed-field work — agent picks the right field type and tests the formula on real records.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants a webhook
user: "Trigger a Slack message every time a high-priority bug is created"
assistant: "I'll use the schema-architect agent to configure the webhook."
<commentary>
HookV3 with condition + Messaging notification — agent uses the webhooks skill.
</commentary>
</example>
