## Agents

- `@flask-developer` — Use this agent when the user needs help building with Flask — writing route handlers, organizing blueprints, designing templates, debugging Flask errors, or working with Flask extensions in their project.

<example>
Context: User is adding a new feature to a Flask app
user: "Help me create a new blueprint for managing appointments with CRUD routes"
assistant: "I'll use the flask-developer agent to build the appointments blueprint."
<commentary>
Developer needs help creating a Flask blueprint with route handlers and templates.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User is debugging a Flask error
user: "I'm getting a circular import error when I try to import my models in a route file"
assistant: "I'll use the flask-developer agent to diagnose and fix the circular import."
<commentary>
Developer has a common Flask structural issue — agent can analyze the import chain and fix it.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: User wants to improve Flask app architecture
user: "My Flask app has all routes in one file, help me split it into blueprints"
assistant: "I'll use the flask-developer agent to refactor the app into a blueprint structure."
<commentary>

</commentary>
