# /teams-dev:add-feature

Adds an incremental feature to an existing Microsoft Teams app built on the `@microsoft/teams.*` 2.1 packages. The argument selects the feature.

## Feature router

Match `$ARGUMENTS` case-insensitively, hyphens and spaces interchangeable:

| Argument | Skill to invoke | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| `message`, `message-handler`, `bot`, `proactive`, `stream` | `messaging` | A message handler with `send`/`reply`, streaming, targeted or proactive messages |
| `card`, `adaptive-card` | `adaptive-cards` | A card built with the 2.x builders and a `card.action.<action>` handler |
| `dialog`, `task-module` | `dialogs` | `dialog.open.<id>` and `dialog.submit.<action>` handlers |
| `message-extension`, `compose-extension`, `me` | `message-extensions` | `message.ext.*` handlers plus the manifest command |
| `tab`, `static-tab`, `function` | `tabs` | `app.tab()`, `app.function()` and the browser client |
| `ai`, `ai-agent`, `openai`, `llm` | `ai-agents` | The `openai` SDK with `runTools()`, streaming and history in turn state |
| `mcp`, `mcp-server`, `mcp-client`, `a2a` | `mcp-a2a` | `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` or `@a2a-js/sdk` mounted next to the bot |
| `sso`, `auth`, `signin`, `oauth` | `authentication` | `app.addOAuthFlow()`, callbacks, manifest `webApplicationInfo` |
| `graph`, `microsoft-graph` | `graph-integration` | A Graph client with the app's or the user's token |
| `state`, `memory` | `sdk-patterns` (section 2) | `new App({ state: true })` and the conversation and user scopes |
| `test`, `playground` | `agents-playground` | Local testing without a registration |

If no argument matches, ask the user which of these to add — do not guess.

## Steps

1. Read `package.json` and `src/index.ts` (or `src/main.ts`). Confirm Node 22.12 or newer and `@microsoft/teams.apps` 2.1 or newer; if the project is on an older 2.0 preview line, say that the 2.x APIs in these skills need the upgrade first (`npm install @microsoft/teams.apps@latest` and the sibling packages).
2. Invoke the matching skill from the table; follow its code, not a remembered older API.
3. Propose a minimal diff. Do not refactor code the feature does not touch.
4. Type-check before suggesting a run:

   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

5. Tell the user how to try it: the Agents Playground for message-level features (`agents-playground`), the Teams client for tabs, dialogs, extensions and sign-in.

## Notes

- Re-read `src/index.ts` before editing; the user may have customised `new App({ … })`.
- Features that touch the manifest (`message-extension`, `tab`, `sso`, dialogs that open web pages) change it through the CLI — `teams app manifest download|upload|update`, `teams app update` — not through a manifest file, because the scaffolded project has none (`Skill: cli-recipes`). The user reinstalls the app in Teams afterwards when the manifest changed.
- Streaming works in 1:1 chats only, one stream per chat, for two minutes from the first chunk. Flag this when adding `ai`.
- Add credentials and keys to `.env`, never to code, and keep `.env` out of git.
- SSO and OAuth need an Azure-managed bot; check with `teams app bot get <teamsAppId>` and offer `teams app bot migrate` if it is Teams-managed.
