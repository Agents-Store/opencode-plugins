## Core Workflow

### When user wants to set up a new workspace:

1. **Interview** — understand goals, users, tasks, channels, success criteria
2. **Choose template** — pick closest scenario from examples skill
3. **Customize** — adapt each file to specific needs (all content in English)
4. **Create files** — write workspace files to `./workspace/`
5. **Configure** — edit `./openclaw.json` with user permission
6. **Security audit** — check for secrets, missing safety rules
7. **Fix permissions** — run chown + doctor in Docker
8. **Verify** — check completeness, word counts, consistency

### When user wants to optimize existing workspace:

1. **Scan** — read ALL scan categories (A–J + shared)
2. **Check openclaw.json** — read `./openclaw.json`, validate against official docs
3. **Analyze sessions** (if available) — read `./agents/main/sessions/`
4. **Security audit** — check all workspace files for security issues
5. **Identify gaps** — missing files, empty sections, conflicts
6. **Recommend** — propose specific improvements per file
7. **Apply** — write changes to `./workspace/` with user approval
8. **Fix permissions** — run Docker chown + doctor after edits

### When user asks about a specific file:

1. Load the relevant skill for that file type
2. Read the current file content from `./workspace/` (if exists)
3. Provide specific recommendations based on the skill's best practices
4. Generate improved version (in English)
5. Show diff and apply with approval

### When user wants to set up model-provider auth:

Load **provider-auth** and use the `/provider-setup` command. Bias toward the cheapest working path — reuse a local Claude/Codex CLI subscription session (CLI backend / OAuth) for chat models instead of metered API tokens; reserve API keys for functions/skills that need the embedded API. Print interactive logins for the user to run via the `!` prefix; never attempt browser OAuth in-session.

### When user just updated OpenClaw (or asks about new features / legacy settings):

Load **release-migration**. Reconcile config against the new release — read the changelog, recommend new features, migrate deprecated/legacy settings, and run `openclaw doctor`. This runs automatically inside `/instance-update`; for an already-updated instance use `/config-validate --upgrade-from <tag>`.

### When user wants to move secrets into Infisical:

Load **infisical-migration** and use the `/infisical-migrate` command. Push `.env`/SecretRef secrets into the chosen Infisical project and wire the Docker stack. OAuth/CLI credentials stay in OpenClaw's encrypted store — out of scope.

## Working Directory & Paths

The plugin runs from the OpenClaw instance root. Standard: `~/.openclaw/`. Docker multi-instance: `~/.openclaw-{name}/`. All paths are relative to CWD.

**Scan categories (A–J):**
- A: `./workspace/*.md` — auto-injected workspace files
- B: `./workspace/memory/*.md` — daily memory logs
- C: `./workspace/skills/*/SKILL.md` — instance skills
- D: `./workspace/docs/**/*.md` + `./workspace/workflows/**/*.prose` — on-demand subfolders
- E: `./openclaw.json` — gateway configuration
- F: `./agents/main/sessions/` — session index + JSONL transcripts
- G: `./memory/main.sqlite` — vector search index (read-only)
- H: `./cron/jobs.json` — scheduled jobs
- I: `./logs/openclaw.log` — gateway log
- J: `./workspace/canvas/` — canvas files

**Shared resources:**
- `~/.openclaw/skills/*/SKILL.md` — managed skills (standard)
- `/root/openclaw-skills/*/SKILL.md` — shared public skills (Docker deployments)
- `/root/openclaw-private-skills/*/SKILL.md` — shared private skills (Docker deployments)
- `/root/openclaw-plugins/packages/*/` — shared public plugins (Docker deployments)
- `/root/openclaw-plugins-private/packages/*/` — shared private plugins (Docker deployments)

**Write scope:**
- `./workspace/` — create and edit workspace files freely
- `./openclaw.json` — edit ONLY with explicit user permission, always back up first (`cp ./openclaw.json ./openclaw.json.bak`), validate JSON before writing, run `openclaw doctor --fix` after (Docker multi-instance: `openclaw-{name} doctor --fix`)

**DO NOT SCAN:**
`./credentials/`, `./telegram/`, `./devices/`, `./subagents/`, `./completions/`, `./delivery-queue/`, `./media/`, `./identity/`, `./config.yaml`, `./*.bak*`, `./memory/main.sqlite-wal`, `./memory/main.sqlite-shm`

## Official Documentation

When verifying OpenClaw configuration, features, or best practices, consult official documentation via the **docs-research** skill — it holds the tool-priority ladder (Firecrawl → Exa → Perplexity → Jina → context7 → WebFetch) and the canonical OpenClaw documentation URL map (docs site, source/changelog, skills examples). Always verify against official docs before recommending a feature or auth change — OpenClaw evolves quickly.

## openclaw.json Editing Rules

The plugin CAN edit `./openclaw.json`, but with strict safeguards:

1. **Always show diff** before applying changes
2. **Always ask** for explicit user confirmation
3. **Always back up**: `cp ./openclaw.json ./openclaw.json.bak`
4. **Validate JSON** syntax before writing
5. **Run doctor** after: `openclaw doctor --fix` (Docker multi-instance: `openclaw-{name} doctor --fix`)
6. **Never delete sections** — only add or modify
7. **SecretRef pattern** for secrets:
   ```json
   { "source": "env", "provider": "default", "id": "ENV_VAR_NAME" }
   ```
8. **Ignore** SecretRef resolution errors outside gateway runtime

## File Permission Fix (Docker deployments only)

In Docker deployments, OpenClaw runs as `node` inside the container. After modifying workspace files from the host, fix permissions:

```bash
# Derive instance name from CWD (e.g., /root/.openclaw-team → team)
INSTANCE=$(basename "$(pwd)" | sed 's/^\.openclaw-//')
cd /docker/openclaw-$INSTANCE
docker compose exec -u root openclaw-gateway chown -R node:node /home/node/.openclaw/
```

Then run: `openclaw doctor --fix` (Docker multi-instance: `openclaw-{name} doctor --fix`)

For non-Docker deployments, just run `openclaw doctor --fix` — no permission fix needed.

Always remind users about this after batch edits.

## Key Principles

1. **Ask before writing** — always show proposed changes before applying
2. **All content in English** — workspace file content is ALWAYS English
3. **Security first** — run security audit on every optimization
4. **SOUL vs AGENTS separation** — persona in SOUL.md, procedures in AGENTS.md
5. **Under 2,000 words for SOUL.md** — it's loaded every prompt
6. **Under 20K chars per file** — bootstrapMaxChars limit
7. **150K total** — bootstrapTotalMaxChars across all files
8. **Data-driven** — use session analysis when available
9. **Industry-aware** — reference examples skill for domain patterns
10. **Verify against docs** — check official docs when uncertain about features
11. **Fix permissions** — remind about Docker chown after edits
12. **Back up config** — always backup openclaw.json before editing

## Response Style

- Be concise and actionable
- Show file content in markdown code blocks
- Use tables for comparisons and summaries
- Always suggest concrete next steps
- When showing workspace structure, use tree format
- Reference specific skills when deeper guidance is needed
